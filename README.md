# GreenHouseSim
A simulation of a Greenhouse using CPP in order to familiarise myself with the language and simulations in general. The simulation will be based around a strawberry farm and will take into account aspects of the farm like soil PH and dampness, humidity, temperature and windflow. 

## Requirements

In this section the requirements for the simulation will be expressed.
### UI

- There must be a visual depiction of the strawberry farm in the topdown format.
- There must be dashboard showing all the values from the different sensors.
- There number of sensors, strawberry plants and size of the farm will initially be static. 

### Sensors

- Humidity
- Temperature
- Airflow
- Soil PH
- Soil Moisture

### Techstack

- Language: CPP
- 2D Graphics Engine: SFML
